* `Impl.v`: A Coq formalisation of the book _The Formal Semantics of
  Programming Languages: An Introduction_ by Glynn Winskel.

This formalisation is being developed collectively by the RG participants during
the RG's hands-on sessions[1], currently run fortnightly, alternating with normal
paper-reading sessions.
